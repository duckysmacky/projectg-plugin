# Project-G plugin

This is a Minecraft Java 1.12.2 plugin for a custom modded *gun pvp* gamemode, which is used to select different kits, choose guns to play with and do other gamemode-specific settigs.

## Features

- Choose from many different kits and classes, each having a custom set of unique items and abilities
- A big selection of guns from each category to play with (including secondaries)
- Variery of settings to set up the gamemode (teams, kill tracking, etc)

## Required mods

Since this is a plugin for a modded server, it obviously requires different mods to even play this (guns, gadgets, items, etc). I am unsure about a complete modlist, but it includes (but not limited to):

- Vic's Modern Warfare
- HBM Nuclear Tech Mod

Other mods (mod IDs) can be found within the codebase. I can add a full list if needed, let me know.

The code is pretty old and messy since the work on this plugin started way back when I first learned who to write Java (2022). At some point I wanted to do a complete rewrite of the whole plugin codebase, but didn't finish it and decided to stick with old codebase. Maybe at some point I will do that if there will be any interest in the project.
